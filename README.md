# Joan Claret Boilerplate

### What is?
I built this repository based on Joan Leon's Boilerplate (https://github.com/nucliweb/nucliweb-Boilerplate).
The idea is to have an initial base to start new projects.

### Content
Includes a package.json (with gulp, gulp-sass, gulp-minify-css and gulp-util), a gulpfile.js with some simple tasks, and Twitter boostratp's grid.
