# Joan Claret Boilerplate

### What is?
This is a repository based on Joan Leon's Boilerplate (https://github.com/nucliweb/nucliweb-Boilerplate).
The idea is to have an initial base to start new projects.

### Include

* package.json (with gulp, gulp-sass, gulp-minify-css and gulp-util)
* gulpfile.js with some simple tasks 
* Twitter boostratp's grid
* SASS variables configuration file (scss/lib/variables.scss)
* A bunch of SASS mixins (scss/lib/mixins.scss)
* Debug stylesheet (scss/debug.scss)
* Javascript file to enable use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer (js/html5ie.js)
* Javascript file to enable min/max-width media query polyfill for IE 8 and older.
